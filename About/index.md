		<p class="mb-0">Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Emily, and I am passionate about helping people with their homes. I am a licensed architect in my home country of the US, but have been living and working in Cambridge since 2010. I believe that good design should be affordable and available to everyone. Too many of us are stuck in houses that are cramped, cold, and awkward. If your house needs an extension, a re-plan, or a sustainable retrofit, I can help.

		<p class="mb-0">“Working with Emily was a breath of fresh air! She listened to all of our thoughts, priorities and requests before helping with the extension and remodel with some good advice. Responsive and keen to make sure we were completely happy before we were ready to go for planning. The 3D video walk through was so good and gave us ideas of things we could change. During the build, we needed a few amendments and nothing was too much trouble. We have a great space that does everything we hoped it would and more. Great service and great value, would definitely recommend!”

		<p class="mb-0">“Emily designed our extension. What really set her apart was ensuring that we got what we needed and wanted. It was a rather challenging project since the space was restricted, but she met all our requirements and wishes. She presented innovative solutions for our space. We had peace of mind, because she took care of all necessities for building regulations and liaised with the structural engineer and builders giving sound advice when needed. We wholeheartedly recommend her.”
